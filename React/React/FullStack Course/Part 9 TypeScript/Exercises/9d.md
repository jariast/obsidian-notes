# Exercise 9.15

The new types were pretty easy to implement, we created `CoursePartDetailed` which extends `CoursePartBase` and adds the `description` property.

The parts component uses the [[9d React with Types#Type Narrowing]] we saw in the course.

# Exercise 9.17

For the Entry form I was planning on doing uncontrolled inputs, but then I realized that I should reset all the inputs after the Entry creation, there's no a clean way of doing it with uncontrolled inputs. Nevertheless in the [[React/Misc Resources/Misc#React TS cheat sheet|TS cheat sheet]] we found a snippet of code like this:

```ts
const handleSubmit = (e: SyntheticEvent) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    const target = e.target as typeof e.target & {
      date: { value: string };
    };

    const date = target.date.value;
  };
```

The interesting bit is the line where we're asserting the type of the target, this is called [Type Intersection](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/objects.html#intersection-types).
