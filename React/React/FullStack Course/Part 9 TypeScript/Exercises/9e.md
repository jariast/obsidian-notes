# 9.21: Patientor, step2 - Single Patient Page

We started by the easy stuff, we created the new method for fetching a single patient in the service.

We must fetch the patient data in the `PatienView` component, because the list of patients that we have in the rest of the App only has non-sensitive data in it. We make use of the `useParams` hook in order to retrieve the `id` from the route:

```ts
const patientId = useParams().id;
```

We fetch the patient inside a `useEffect` hook. We then use the patient's gender to choose the correct Icon element for their gender:

```ts
switch (patient?.gender) {
    case Gender.Male:
      icon = <Male></Male>;
      break;
    case Gender.Female:
      icon = <Female></Female>;
      break;
    case Gender.Other:
      icon = <Transgender></Transgender>;
      break;
    default:
      break;
  }
```

# 9.25: Patientor, step6

On each of the specific type of entries, we're going to use the [[Fullstack Course#Extract]] utility type to extract each specific type in the props of the component:

```ts
type ExtractedHospitalEntry = Extract<Entry, { type: 'Hospital' }>;

interface Props {
  entry: ExtractedHospitalEntry;
}
```

In the above code, the `Entry` type is a Union Type, we can use the `Extract` type utility to extract the type that has the `type` "Hospital".

In the Patient View component we're passing each Entry to the `EntryDetails` component, before doing so, we're building a Diagnoses array which contain all the info required to display the diagnoses:

```ts
patient?.entries.map((entry) => {
	entry.diagnosisCodes &&
	  (entry.diagnoses = buildDiagnosesArray(entry.diagnosisCodes));
	return (
	  <Box key={entry.id}>
		<EntryDetails entry={entry} />
	  </Box>
	);
}
```

We went with the approach suggested by the Course, we have a `EntryDetails` component that uses a `switch` statement to render each type of Entry. I think here, we could use some refactoring, we're duplicating a lot of code inside each of the Entry Type components. #reviewSolutionAfterSubmission
