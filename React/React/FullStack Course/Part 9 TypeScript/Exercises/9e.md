# 9.21: Patientor, step2 - Single Patient Page

We started by the easy stuff, we created the new method for fetching a single patient in the service.

We must fetch the patient data in the `PatienView` component, because the list of patients that we have in the rest of the App only has non-sensitive data in it. We make use of the `useParams` hook in order to retrieve the `id` from the route:

```ts
const patientId = useParams().id;
```

We fetch the patient inside a `useEffect` hook. We then use the patient's gender to choose the correct Icon element for their gender:

```ts
switch (patient?.gender) {
    case Gender.Male:
      icon = <Male></Male>;
      break;
    case Gender.Female:
      icon = <Female></Female>;
      break;
    case Gender.Other:
      icon = <Transgender></Transgender>;
      break;
    default:
      break;
  }
```
