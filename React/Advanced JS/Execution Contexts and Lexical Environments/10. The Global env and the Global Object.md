Whenever a JS file is run, it is run in an Execution Context, the Global Execution Context. [[Concepts#Execution Context]]

The Global Exec creates a Global Object and the variable "this". On a browser, the global object is `window`.

Any code that is outside a `function` is attached directly to the Global Object.
