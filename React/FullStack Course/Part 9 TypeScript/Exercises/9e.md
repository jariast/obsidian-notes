# 9.21: Patientor, step2 - Single Patient Page

We started by the easy stuff, we created the new method for fetching a single patient in the service.

We must fetch the patient data in the `PatienView` component, because the list of patients that we have in the rest of the App only has non-sensitive data in it. We make use of the `useParams` hook in order to retrieve the `id` from the route:

```ts
const patientId = useParams().id;
```

We fetch the patient inside a `useEffect` hook. We then use the patient's gender to choose the correct Icon element for their gender:

```ts
switch (patient?.gender) {
    case Gender.Male:
      icon = <Male></Male>;
      break;
    case Gender.Female:
      icon = <Female></Female>;
      break;
    case Gender.Other:
      icon = <Transgender></Transgender>;
      break;
    default:
      break;
  }
```

# 9.25: Patientor, step6

On each of the specific type of entries, we're going to use the [[Fullstack Course#Extract]] utility type to extract each specific type in the props of the component:

```ts
type ExtractedHospitalEntry = Extract<Entry, { type: 'Hospital' }>;

interface Props {
  entry: ExtractedHospitalEntry;
}
```

In the above code, the `Entry` type is a Union Type, we can use the `Extract` type utility to extract the type that has the `type` "Hospital".

In the Patient View component we're passing each Entry to the `EntryDetails` component, before doing so, we're building a Diagnoses array which contain all the info required to display the diagnoses:

```ts
patient?.entries.map((entry) => {
	entry.diagnosisCodes &&
	  (entry.diagnoses = buildDiagnosesArray(entry.diagnosisCodes));
	return (
	  <Box key={entry.id}>
		<EntryDetails entry={entry} />
	  </Box>
	);
}
```

We went with the approach suggested by the Course, we have a `EntryDetails` component that uses a `switch` statement to render each type of Entry. I think here, we could use some refactoring, we're duplicating a lot of code inside each of the Entry Type components. #reviewSolutionAfterSubmission 

# 9.26: Patientor, step7

## Parsing New Entries

We must parse each entry separately because they all have different fields, the most complex one was the Occupational Entry, in there we have an optional `sickLeave` field which itself is an object with two other fields. 

We must check if the field exists in the Object we retrieved from the request and add it to our NewEntry if so:

``` ts
  case 'OccupationalHealthcare':
	if ('employerName' in entryObj) {
	  const newOccupationalEntry: NewEntry = {
		//.... other fields go here
		employerName: parseString(entryObj.employerName),
		...('sickLeave' in entryObj && {
		  sickLeave: parseSickLeave(entryObj.sickLeave),
		}), // Conditionally add sickLeave if the request has it
	  };
	  return newOccupationalEntry;
	}
	break;

```

Above we used spread syntax to add the `sickLeave` field only if `entryObj` has that property. We also use the method `parseSickLeave` to make sure the object has the correct fields and types:

```ts
function parseSickLeave(object: unknown): {
  startDate: string;
  endDate: string;
} {
  if (
    !object ||
    typeof object !== 'object' ||
    !('startDate' in object) ||
    !('endDate' in object)
  ) {
    throw new Error(`Incorrect Sick Leave : ${object}`);
  }
  return {
    startDate: parseDate(object.startDate),
    endDate: parseDate(object.endDate),
  };
}

```

## Health Ratings Type Guards

We are using a numeric Enum to manage the Health Ratings, so in order to guard them we used the following function:

```ts
function isHealthCheckRating(param: number): param is HealthCheckRating {
  return Object.values(HealthCheckRating)
    .filter((v) => !isNaN(Number(v)))
    .includes(param);
}
```

We used the [[Fullstack Course#Iterating Enums]] trick, and once we have the values we can check if the value we're passed by the request is contained.

# Omitting properties in Union Types

As seen in this [GitHub issue](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/42680) Omit types work a little bit weirdly so we must implement an "Improved" omit type:

```ts
type UnionOmit<T, K extends string | number | symbol> = T extends unknown
  ? Omit<T, K>
  : never;
//....
export type Entry =
  | HealthCheckEntry
  | OccupationalHealthcareEntry
  | HospitalEntry;

export type NewEntry = UnionOmit<Entry, 'id'>;
```

# 9.27: Patientor, step8

## FE changes.

### Patients Service
We added a `addEntry` function which takes a `NewEntry` and a PatientId. We used [[9e Grand Finale#Indexed Access Types| this "trick"]] to type the patientId using the definition of the `id` in the `Entry` type.

### Entry Form

We're using [Formik](https://formik.org/docs/overview) to manage our Entry Form.

### Add Entry EndPoint

We had a bug were the function in charge of parsing the `HealthCheckRating`, the function was looking for the string value of the enum and not the number value.

```ts
function isHealthCheckRating(param: number): param is HealthCheckRating {
  return Object.values(HealthCheckRating)
    .filter((v) => isNaN(Number(v)))
    .includes(param);
}
```
We just removed the `!` from the `isNaN(Number(v))` check and the function now checks for the correct number values.

**June 6th Update!!!!**
We actually introduced a bug with the above "fix", the function was filtering values that were *NaN*, the actual bug was when we were using the type guard:

```ts
  if (
    isNaN(ratingNumber) ||
    !isNumber(ratingNumber) ||
    !isHealthCheckRating(ratingNumber)
  ) {
    throw new Error(`Incorrect Health Rating: ${rating}`);
  }
```

We had to add the `!` to the type guard call in order to actually check for the correct values in the Enum.

### Using RTK Query

#### Entry Creation

When we're creating a new Entry there's (I think) a couple of valid ways of handling a request error:

Using `state`:
```ts
const [addNewEntry, { error: entryCreationError, isSuccess }] =
	useAddEntryMutation();
const [error, setError] = useState('');

.....

  useEffect(() => {
    if (entryCreationError) {
      console.log('Error form rtkquery: ', entryCreationError);
      const parsedErrorMsg = parseRTKQueryError(entryCreationError);
      if (parsedErrorMsg) {
        setError(parsedErrorMsg);
      }
    }
  }, [entryCreationError]);

```

Using a variable for JSX elements:

```ts
const [addNewEntry, { error: entryCreationError, isSuccess }] =
	useAddEntryMutation();
	
  let errorMsg;
  if (entryCreationError) {
    const parsedError = parseRTKQueryError(entryCreationError);
    errorMsg = <h1>{`Error: ${parsedError}`}</h1>;
  }
//We can then usee `errorMsg` to actually show the error

```

I think I like the JSX approach better, we don't have to use `useEffect` and it has the added benefit that we don't actually have to clear the state every time we call the `trigger`  function (`addNewEntry` in our case). Every time the trigger is called, the error gets cleared and in the next render the error message simply won't show.
