Service Level Agreement

# Latency
We can have a SLA that states that we must respond to all request within 100ms. We could say our "3 nines" latency is 100ms, meaning that 99.9% of request are responded within 100 ms.

# Availability
99% availability would result in a 3.65 days downtime per year.
99,9999% (6 nines) result in 30 seconds per year.
