They have Nodes that can be connected in arbitrary ways (edges)

# BFS
Breadth-First-Search is the most common way to traverse a Graph. We recursively explore all nodes Edges until we find the required node.

# DFS
Deep-Breadth-First. We traverse the graph by choosing a path and sticking with it until it ends.
