Recursion is a Function that calls itself until the problem is solved, we can consider the problem solved when we reach the Base Case.

ALWAYS think what your Base Case is.

The purpose of Recursion is that in each invocation of the recursive function, we get a little closer to the solution of a problem.

1. What is the simples possible input?
2. Play around with examples and visualize.
3. Relate hard cases to simpler cases.
4. Generalize the pattern.
5. Write code by combining recursive pattern with the base case.
