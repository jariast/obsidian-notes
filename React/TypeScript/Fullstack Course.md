# Utility Types

[Docs](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/utility-types.html#picktype-keys)

We can use utility types to construct  *special* versions of a Type we previously defined, for example, we can remove sensitive information before returning it to a client app. 

## Extract

The `Extract` utility type can be used to extract a type declared inside a Union Type.

# Type guards

[Docs](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/narrowing.html#typeof-type-guards)

When we do checks like `typeof argument === 'number'`, TS analyzes the execution path of the code and narrows the Type of it according to it. 

## Type predicates

We can build our own type guards by creating a function which return type is a `type predicate`. The predicate takes the form `<paramName> is <Type>` where the `<paramName>` is the name of a parameter in the current function signature. The return value of the function has to be a Boolean.

# Type assertions

[Docs](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/everyday-types.html#type-assertions)

Sometimes we (the developer) know what is the type of value, that TS has no way of knowing, for example when parsing a value or when dealing with external data. We can use the `as` operator to coerce a value into certain type:

```ts
const myCanvas = document.getElementById("main_canvas") as HTMLCanvasElement;
```

Here the dev knows that when we pass the id `main_canvas` we'll always get an `HTMLCanvasElement`.

# Iterating Enums

When we iterate over numeric enums, we must be careful because we will loop through both the keys (strings) and the values (numbers), so we must use something like [this](https://bobbyhadz.com/blog/typescript-iterate-enum) to distinguish between the two types of values:

```ts
// ‚úÖ For Numeric Enums
enum Sizes {
  Small,
  Medium,
  Large,
}

const keys = Object.keys(Sizes).filter((v) => isNaN(Number(v)));
console.log(keys); // üëâÔ∏è ['Small', 'Medium', 'Large']

keys.forEach((key, index) => {
  // üëáÔ∏è Small, Medium, Large
  console.log(key);
});

const values = Object.values(Sizes).filter((v) => !isNaN(Number(v)));
console.log(values); // üëâÔ∏è [0, 1, 2]

values.forEach((value) => {
  // üëáÔ∏è 0, 1, 2
  console.log(value);
});

```
